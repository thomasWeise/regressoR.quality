Title: An R Package Providing Quality Metrics for Input/Output Regression

Description: This package provides quality metrics to measure the error of
    regression models that map an input variable \code{x} to an output
    variable \code{y}. The goal is to encapsulate primitives for such
    metrics into a separate package so that they can easily be extended
    and improved in the near future. Each quality measure is an instance
    of S4 class \code{\link{RegressionQualityMetric}}, which provides
    several fields, including a function for computing the metric, the
    original \code{x} and \code{y} data, and optionally functions for
    computing the Jacobian, the residuals, and a weight vector. Such
    instances are created by functions which accept two vectors \code{x}
    and \code{y} as parameter and return, well, an instance of
    \code{\link{RegressionQualityMetric}}.
    The way the quality metrics are structured allows for linear and
    non-linear regression as well as for using numerical optimization
    methods to fit parametric models.
    Currently, we only support some simple weighted root-mean-square-error
    based measures, where the default one weights samples based on their
    inverse square root of the absolute value (in order to accommodate
    values differing vastly in scale) with fixes for zero values.
    However, in the future, the creation of the quality metrics could involve
    outlier detection and decrease their weights accordingly. This would
    improve the robustness of the regression procedure.
